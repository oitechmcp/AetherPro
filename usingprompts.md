How to Use Generated PromptsThis guide explains how to effectively use the prompts generated by Aether Pro in various popular AI models.1. Midjourney (v6 / Niji)Midjourney is command-line based (Discord). Aether Pro optimizes prompts specifically for this format when "Generative Image" and "Midjourney v6" are selected.Copy & Paste: Copy the output from Aether.Command: Go to your Discord server or DM with the Midjourney Bot. Type /imagine and paste your prompt.Parameters: Aether automatically includes parameters at the end of the prompt:--ar 16:9 (Aspect Ratio)--v 6.0 (Version)--style raw (Less opinionated style)--no text blur (Negative prompting)2. DALL-E 3 (ChatGPT / Bing)DALL-E 3 excels at natural language understanding. When "DALL-E 3" is selected, Aether generates conversational, descriptive paragraphs rather than keyword lists.Usage: Paste the generated text directly into ChatGPT or Bing Image Creator.Tip: You don't need technical parameters (like --ar) for DALL-E inside ChatGPT; simply asking for "Wide aspect ratio" in the text (which Aether does) is sufficient.3. Stable Diffusion (SDXL / Automatic1111)Stable Diffusion relies heavily on separating "Positive" and "Negative" prompts.Standard Mode: Aether combines these into one block for readability. You may need to manually separate the --no section if your UI has a distinct "Negative Prompt" box.JSON Mode: Use the JSON mode in Aether! It explicitly separates subject, style, and parameters. This is perfect for copy-pasting into specific fields in Automatic1111 or ComfyUI.4. Video Generation (Runway / Sora / Pika)When "Cinematic Video" is selected, Aether switches context to describe motion and camera movement rather than just static details.Keywords: Look for terms like "pan right", "drone shot", "slow motion", and "high bitrate".Usage: Paste these directly into the text input of Runway Gen-2 or Pika Labs.5. Audio Generation (Suno / AudioLDM)When "Audio/SFX" is selected, visual descriptors are replaced with auditory ones.Keywords: Look for "BPM", "Reverb", "Instrumentation", and "Mood".Usage: Perfect for text-to-audio models. Note that some models (like Suno) prefer lyrics + style, while others (AudioLDM) prefer pure description. Aether defaults to descriptive style.
